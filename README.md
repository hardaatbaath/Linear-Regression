# Linear-Regression
This is a basic program that applies the mathematical concept of Linear Regression to a data set that has been provided along in the repository. The data points are linear in nature and have no real world significance.
The program tries to come up with the best line of the form y = W.x + B, via the concept of Gradient Descent. The user has to input the learning rate and number of Epochs.
The program then uses the prebuilt Linear Regression library of Sklearn, and applies the same data set to it as well.
The accuracy of the model is predicted using the R squared value of the model.
